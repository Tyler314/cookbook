Directions

Butterfly the chicken breasts to increase surface area, and add them to a Crockpot. Add the peanut butter, soy sauce, and honey to a mixing bowl and mix ingredients thoroughly. Dice garlic cloves and add them to the mix as well. Pour mixture over the chicken breasts in the Crockpot and stir chicken to ensure even distribution of the mixture.

Set temperature to the \textit{low} setting, and let cook for 6-7 hours, occasionally mixing the chicken if possible. It will be done when the chicken is tender and falling apart. Serve and enjoy!
