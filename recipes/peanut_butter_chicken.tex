Directions
\newline

Butterfly the chicken breasts to increase surface area, and add them to a Crockpot.

Add all ingredients to mixing bowl, and mix until you achieve a consistent texture, the sauce will be slightly lumpy. Pour mixture over the chicken breasts in the Crockpot and stir chicken to ensure even distribution of the mixture.

Set temperature to the \textit{low} setting, and let cook for 5-6 hours, occasionally mixing the chicken if possible. It will be done when the chicken is tender and falling apart. Serve and enjoy!
