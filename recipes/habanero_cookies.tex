Directions
\newline

Beat the shortening, margarine, sugars, eggs, and vanilla in a bowl until a homogeneous consistency is achieved. In a separate bowl, mix the flour, baking soda, salt, and cayenne pepper. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix thoroughly, then set aside.

Remove the pith and the stem from the peppers, such that you are left with only the fruit and the seeds. Place the fruit and seeds of the peppers into a mood processor or blender and mince. Mix the minced peppers into the dough. Roll the dough into 1.5 inch diameter spheres and place them approximately 2 inches apart onto a lightly greased baking sheet.

Bake for 9-11 minutes, or until the cookies are slightly browned. Let them cool for 3 minutes and remove from baking sheet.

Yields 3-4 dozen cookies.
